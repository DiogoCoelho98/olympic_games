# Olympic Games Chronicles

## Description
**Olympic Games Chronicles** is a website that explores the rich history of the Olympic Games. Built using WordPress and hosted on a backend powered by Oracle VirtualBox running a Debian Linux virtual machine, this project represents a significant milestone in my development journey. This was my first time working with Oracle VirtualBox, Linux as an OS (Debian), and WordPress for website creation via its admin dashboard.
